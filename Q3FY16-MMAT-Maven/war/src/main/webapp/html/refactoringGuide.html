This refactoring guide is intended to help application developers
refactor their existing applications for the purpose of adding the UI
2.0 standard page layout wrapper around their application. Three
layouts are available: 1, 2, and 3 column. The 2 and 3 column layouts
utilize CEC standard navigation and require the use of <a
 href="https://wwwin.cisco.com/webdev/intranet/design-2/hinav/">hiNav</a>
from CEC. If you haven't created or published a hinav.xml file before,
you may wish to refer to the <a
 href="https://wwwin.cisco.com/webdev/intranet/design-2/hinav/hinav3.shtml">hinav
coding instructions</a> or <span
 style="font-weight: bold; background-color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">deploying
hinav</span>.
<br>
Application refactoring to incorporate the UI 2.0 standard should be
performed outside of a major release cycle if possible - perhaps during
analysis of an upcoming release.
<br>
<h4>The following refactorings will be discussed:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Servlet based - JSPs not used</li>
  <li><a href="#jspsSimpleCase">JSPs - simple case</a></li>
  <li><a href="#strutsWithJspView">Struts with JSP view</a></li>
  <li>Struts with Velocity view</li>
  <li>Turbine with Velocity view</li>
  <li>Turbine with JSP view</li>
  <li>Jetspeed with Velocity view</li>
  <li>JSPs - other/proprietary framework case</li>
  <li>Velocity - other framwork</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="jspsSimpleCase"></a>JSPs - simple case</h4>
Separate out the main body content of your application, with any
header, footer, or navigation code removed.&nbsp; This body content
will be defined as the __bodyContent within the tiles context and
rendered using the selected UI2 standard layout template. <br>
<br>
This example uses in-line content to simulate an undecorated
page.&nbsp;&nbsp; A simple jsp is created to demonstrate the 1, 2, and
3 column templates using the
sample war file provided with the uiComponents.<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<ol>
  <li>download and <a href="templateSetup.do">setup</a>
(if you haven't already) the template sample application</li>
  <li>in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">&lt;TOMCAT_HOME&gt;/webapps/uiComponents</span>
directory, create a file named example.jsp, and insert the
following content<br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>&lt;%@ taglib
uri="/tags/struts-tiles" prefix="tiles" %&gt;</code><br>
    <code>&lt;tiles:insert definition=".def.1c.template"
flush="true"&gt;</code><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>&lt;tiles:put
name="__headTitle"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
value="Hello World Example" type="string" /&gt;</code><br>
    <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;tiles:put name="__bodyContent"&nbsp;
value="Hello World!"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
type="string" /&gt;</code><br>
    <code>&lt;/tiles:insert&gt;</code><br>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li> Access it at
https://localhost/uiComponents/example.jsp.&nbsp; <br>
You'll notice several instances of "attribute not defined".&nbsp; In a
real jsp, these attributes would be defined similar to the way you've
defined "__bodyContent" in example.jsp above.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Change def.1c.template to def.2c.template and def.3c.template and
refresh your browser to see the numguess example wrapped in the 2 and 3
column template layouts respectively.</li>
</ol>
</div>
The previous example used value="Hello World!" type="string" to in-line
the __bodyContent.&nbsp; This example demonstrates the ease of
decorating&nbsp; an existing JSP with the UI standard template.&nbsp; <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<ol>
  <li>download and <a href="templateSetup.do">setup</a>
(if you haven't already) the template sample application</li>
  <li>in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">&lt;TOMCAT_HOME&gt;/webapps/uiComponents</span>
directory, create a file named examplePage.jsp, and insert the
following content<br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>&lt;%@ taglib
uri="/tags/struts-tiles" prefix="tiles" %&gt;</code><br>
    <code>&lt;tiles:insert definition=".def.1c.template"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>&lt;tiles:put

value="Hello World Example" type="string" /&gt;</code><br>
    <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;tiles:put name="__bodyContent"&nbsp;
value="/exampleJSP.jsp" /&gt;</code><br>
    <code>&lt;/tiles:insert&gt;</code><br>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">&lt;TOMCAT_HOME&gt;/webapps/uiComponents</span>
directory, create a file named exampleJSP.jsp, and insert the
following content<br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">&lt;h2&gt;Hello JSP
World!&lt;/h2&gt;<code></code></div>
  </li>
  <li>Access it at
https://localhost/uiComponents/examplePage.jsp.&nbsp; <br>
You'll notice several instances of "attribute not defined".&nbsp; In a

defined "__bodyContent" in example.jsp above.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Change def.1c.template to def.2c.template and def.3c.template and

<h4><a name="strutsWithJspView"></a>Struts with JSP view</h4>
For those of you using a pre 1.1 version of Struts,&nbsp; an upgrade to
v1.1 will be required in order to use the templates.&nbsp; In this
case, you may already be using Tiles and have the body content
separate from any header, footer, etc. sections.&nbsp; If so, great, if
not, you will need to remove such decorations from each JSP page in use.<br>

Refactoring steps</h4>
<ol>
  <li>If your code is not in cvs (or maybe even if so) create a local
backup of&nbsp; your code.</li>
  <li>Start with a single JSP and work through the refactoring process,
stripping out the header, footer, and navigation sections of a single
page and perform a complete conversion of it to the UI2 standard
templates before attempting another page.</li>
